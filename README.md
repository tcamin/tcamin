## Hi there üëã

My name is **Tomas** I'm part of a platform team where I get to work on improving mobile developer experience and productivity. I automate things and enjoy creating tools that allow to build and ship apps quicker and more efficiently.

### Current projects üî≠

Here some of the projects I'm maintaining ‚ù§Ô∏è:

- [SBTUITestTunnel](https://github.com/Subito-it/SBTUITestTunnel) A library that extends the XCUITest framework allowing to dynamically mock network requests
- [PodBuilder](https://github.com/Subito-it/PodBuilder) A complementary tool to CocoaPods that speeds up compilation by prebuilding pods into frameworks
- [Cachi](https://github.com/Subito-it/Cachi) Parse and visualize .xcresults on a web interface
- [Mendoza](https://github.com/Subito-it/Mendoza) Improve XCUITests execution speed by sharding over multiple physical machines

### Fun fact ‚ö°

Back in the days, before AI was a thing, I built an app to measure the tennis serve with the iPhone camera. All what remains of this jewel that I built together with @tommyborghi is this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxyR0lSPMrk)
